## The goal of this program is ease of use and correctly grabbing every post. <br/> 
***Linux one line install*** \
`wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fitzy1293/redditsfinder/master/install.sh | bash`


***Windows & Mac***\
Copy and paste the code from push.py wherever you want. \
To do the one line install on Windows you could use a linux virtual machine, or get Ubuntu from the Windows store which is apparently possible. 

# How to use
If you did the full linux install. `redditsfinder[redditUsername]` \
If you only ran the first linux install command or are on Windows or Mac. `python3 push.py [redditUsername]` \
Make sure you're in the redditsfinder directory for the python interpreter way.\
**Make sure you have python3 installed**.
