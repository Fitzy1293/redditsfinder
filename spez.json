            "body": "I empathize with your post. I'm 36, and I went through a phase about a year ago where I wanted to get more disciplined about working out because I wanted to see more consistent progress. I got on a consistent routine, started tracking more, ate better, and generally became more intentional with exercise. I started making progress and was really enjoying myself. However, it seemed like every time I was really getting into the groove, I'd pull, strain, or otherwise hurt something and then be out of commission for a while for a couple of weeks.\n\nThere are two things that have really helped, and I can say happily that I've been relatively injury free for a while and the setbacks I have had are for days not weeks.\n\nThe first is physical. I've really embraced warming up. I used to think that a long warmup would exhaust me and prevent me from performing well for the meat of the workout. Instead, now I think about how I can't perform my best unless unless my heart is moving, my blood is flowing, and everything is fully activated. For any particular exercise\u2014especially if I'm going to try and push it that day\u2014I do a bunch (4+) warmup sets to really get things going, and instead of telling myself that I'm a little tired, I tell myself that I'm warmed up and ready to go.\n\nThe second is mental. I used to tell myself that I'm getting older and injuries are just part of things now, and even worse, that when I hurt myself that it'll take a long time to heal because I'm older. I can guarantee if that if that's what you tell yourself, that will be your experience. On the other hand, I've found that if I don't accept that reality that I can both avoid injury generally and bounce back quickly when I do hurt something. If I tweak something, I go back to that muscle the very next day\u2014usually with a lighter weight and being super intentional about good form\u2014and prove to myself that the injury isn't going to be a factor. I've bounced back a couple times in days from what used to take me weeks in the past.\n\nPlease include a reasonable disclaimer about me not being a professional. Just thought I'd share what's worked for me.",

In the early days, Reddit didn't feel that special, but as the internet evolved and social media exploded, I began to wonder if our idealism about privacy and community put us in the minority, and today, I'm pleased to see these ideas which have always been important to us have become more important in the mainstream.\n\n\\&gt; Are there any Reddit posts from those years that you specifically remember and that stand out to you?\n\nMany. But the goofy one that always comes to mind first was the giant ascii art of Fry's head. It was hilariously clever, but was also the inspiration for the limit to post title length.",

To that end, we have removed a number of their moderators over the years for not moderating to our standards, and we wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do this again, or take additional steps, should their behavior warrant it. While they can be offensive and antagonistic to the rest of Reddit, we have not found them to be in consistent violation of our content policies.\n\nYes, we do see individual posts and comments that cross the line, but the offending content also gets removed as we ask and expect, and we also take action against those individual users and accounts with suspensions or full bans from the site as appropriate.\n\nI wish there was a solution that was as simple as banning the community\u2014certainly it would make some things easier\u2014but the reality is that banning a large political community that isn\u2019t in violation of our policies would be hugely problematic, not just for Reddit, but for our democracy generally. Political speech is the most protected form of speech in the United States, and we are sensitive to that and take cues from the government when we think about our policies.\n\nI know this isn\u2019t the answer many of you are looking for, but as we continue to deliberate and evolve our thinking, my hope is that you appreciate the complexity of this situation and understand our approach.",

Towards that end, we\u2019ve increased accounts banned for content manipulation by 250% since 2017, and we\u2019ve increased the rate at which we proactively action accounts from 29% in 2017 to 99% today.

As our capabilities get better, the adversary also gets better. \n\nDetection today is reliant on technical indicators (such as IP) and leveraging our data scientists to detect abnormal behavior.\n\nOne common vector of attack is to hack otherwise legitimate dormant or insecure accounts and then use them to manipulate Reddit. Working against that, we have focused on improving account security to prevent malicious bots from taking over these accounts. Please see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/bletrr/how_to_keep_your_reddit_account_safe/) for how you can help improve the security of your account\n\nOf course, not all bots are bad bots: r/subredditsimulator, automod, auto crossposting news bots, etc. One option is to ask helpful community bots to self-identify, leaving the potentially malicious bots for us to deal with.",

That communities can create their own rules and enforce them and that users can reject content and behaviors through downvotes and social pressure is very powerful.\n\nUsing fake news as an example, we think it is problematic for a private company, or even worse, me as an individual, or the government, to decide which news sources are valid and which are not. Communities, however, are free to choose which news sources they accept and reject. In fact, our news communities are among our most aggressively moderated. There is a huge difference between a private company deciding what is and isn\u2019t news vs our users doing the same thing. \n\nThat said, we do our best to fight coordinated or inauthentic content, working on both the policy and product fronts to prevent our voting systems from being abused while at the same time increasing the sophistication of community governance, and banning / limiting users that try to manipulate our systems and communities.",

My reasoning was that it feels bad to receive downvotes, and getting downvoted is an especially poor experience if you're a new user. If our goal is to make Reddit more welcoming and accessible, we were working against ourselves. Also, downvotes are weaponized by users and communities to harass and brigade, further compounding the problem.\n\nHowever, despite their flaws, downvotes are a critical tool for communities to develop and maintain their voice, and without them we couldn't scale moderation. There are only so many moderators and far fewer admins, and by allowing community members to moderate content in a lightweight way, they can develop their own identities and voice and keep out the junk (most of it at least).\n\nI know downvotes have their flaws, but they've been critical to growth of every large subreddit, making addressing their flows supremely important. Improving downvotes is one of our current initiatives, and hopefully you'll feel the changes in the coming weeks if you haven't noticed already.",

I did attempt to leave a [couple](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9ld746/you_have_thousands_of_questions_i_have_dozens_of/e75s1o8/) [responses](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9ld746/you_have_thousands_of_questions_i_have_dozens_of/e75wos8/) on the topic, and I have attempted to other respond many times in the past, but since my answer is never \"yep, they're getting banned,\" I end up buried. So it goes.\n\nIt's really isn't my intention to ignore people. I'll probably do another AMA in the near future, and if someone wants to ask simply \"why don't you ban r/the_donald?\" I'll do my best to answer honestly and politely, though my answer will probably look a lot like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7u2zpi/not_my_first_could_be_my_last_state_of_the/dth6eq9/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=announcements).\n\nAnyway, long story short, if u/2Grateful2BHateful or any of you want to say Hi this weekend, I'm more than happy to chat about this or anything else.

What we found in this case was that the users behind it were indeed of Russian origin, though we have no technical evidence that they are affiliated with the IRA. Similar to the IRA's previous efforts, this group's efforts were largely not effective: They submitted 953 posts to 130 different communities. Of the 264 posts submitted to r/the_donald, only one made it into the top 100, and 0 made it into the top 25.\n\nWe have a team dedicated to finding and preventing coordinated behavior to manipulate Reddit. The first question whenever we find anything is, \"what could we have done to find this sooner?\" In this case, we would have liked to have caught and banned the domains sooner because they were behaving in a spammy matter, and have adjusted our processes to do so going forward.\n\nIf you do find anything of this nature, please send it to directly to investigations@reddit.zendesk.com.\n",

As a result, r/science and the other defaults had high visibility at the expense of non\\-default communities.\n\nr/science used to promote AMAs by removing other more popular posts so that the AMA could be top of r/science without the votes. This, combined with being a default community, sent a lot of traffic to these AMAs.\n\n**How it works today**\n\nWe replaced the defaults with r/popular, which is basically a SFW version of r/all. This puts all communities on an equal footing.\n\nWe don't allow the post manipulation for obvious reasons. Here is a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/77o0wm/friday_discussion_thread_what_unique_challenges/donto0j/?context=3) we had with u/nallen on this topic months ago.\n\nWe are indeed testing new sorting algorithms, but if anything they should help communities like r/science get more visibility. One of our engineers recently wrote a [pretty good post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/8kf5wm/reddits_first_pass_ranker/) about it.\n\n**Going forward**\n\nRegardless of u/nallen's decision, we will continue to work to improve our onboarding and sorting so that users get to see more of what they love, and we have in mind some specific features that will help promote \"event\" posts \\(AMAs, game threads, episode threads\\) in the future.",

Go to [https://www.reddit.com/prefs/](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/) and uncheck \"use the redesign as my default experience.\" I know the prefs page is a bit of a mess. It's one of the things we're rebuilding in the redesign. We have no plans to turn off old.reddit.com. \n\nAs for why:\n\n1. New tech stack. The existing codebase is nearly impossible to build in. The redesign gives us a modern platform in which to develop. In the redesign we're able to ship lots of stuff every week. [Here's our most recent update.](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8jgu1q/51518_release_notes_inbox_count_post_flair/)\n2. Easier to use. r2, our name for the legacy site, is quite difficult to grok. We see and lose a lot of potential users every day because they don't know wtf Reddit is. Engagement in our native apps is 2\u20135x higher even though the content is identical. Part of this is due to the phone form factor, but part of this is do to a more visceral UI.\n3. Adapt Reddit to its content. When r2 was built, Reddit was 100&amp;#37; outbound links and self\\-posts. Today, we have a lot more media and have plans to add more post types. The UI should support that.\n4. Ads. In\\-feed ads are what advertisers want to buy. Yes, they're in\\-feed, which I know isn't popular, but it also means our top post is an organic post now instead of an ad. We will continue to iterate on the styling.\n5. Perception. We will no longer have to explain our ancient UI to potential partners, which really was quite a hurdle. Reddit being synonymous with \"old and difficult to use\" isn't good for business.\n6. Portable styles. I know there's a lot of heat around this one as well, but structured styles allow community styling to work across platforms, which is important given the majority of our traffic today is mobile. It also makes community styling easier and therefore more accessible to more communities.\n\nWe've still got a lot to do, but we started rolling it out because we decided it was good enough to get going, and if we waited until it was perfect, we'd never ship. Plus, having the user base providing constant \"feedback\" is highly motivating to the team.\n\nPersonally, I've switched my desktop Reddit\\-ing to the redesign and am pretty happy. I'd encourage folks to give it a try. If you don't like it, opt\\-out and hopefully check back in in a month. It's updating rapidly.",

I decided to answer this direct question knowing it would be a difficult one because it comes up on Reddit quite a bit. I\u2019d like to add more nuance to my answer:\n\nWhile the words and expressions you refer to aren\u2019t explicitly forbidden, the behaviors they often lead to are. \n\nTo be perfectly clear, while racism itself isn\u2019t against the rules, it\u2019s not welcome here. I try to stay neutral on most political topics, but this isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nI believe the best defense against racism and other repugnant views, both on Reddit and in the world, is instead of trying to control what people can and cannot say through rules, is to repudiate these views in a free conversation, and empower our communities to do so on Reddit.\n\nWhen it comes to enforcement, we separate behavior from beliefs. We cannot control people\u2019s beliefs, but we can police their behaviors. As it happens, communities dedicated racist beliefs end up banned for violating rules we do have around harassment, bullying, and violence.\n\nThere exist repugnant views in the world. As a result, these views may also exist on Reddit. I don\u2019t want them to exist on Reddit any more than I want them to exist in the world, but I believe that presenting a sanitized view of humanity does us all a disservice. It\u2019s up to all of us to reject these views.\n\nThese are complicated issues, and we may not always agree, but I am listening to your responses, and I do appreciate your perspectives. Our policies have changed a lot over the years, and will continue to evolve into the future. Thank you.\n\n**Original response:**\n\nIt's not. On Reddit, the way in which we think about speech is to separate behavior from beliefs. This means on Reddit there will be people with beliefs different from your own, sometimes extremely so. When users actions conflict with our content policies, we take action.\n\nOur approach to governance is that communities can set appropriate standards around language for themselves. Many communities have rules around speech that are more restrictive than our own, and we fully support those rules.",

The vast majority of these accounts were rejected by our communities back in 2015\u20132016 before Russia was even a topic of conversation.

Back in the beginning, we created the 1-in-10 rule, which meant that you were only allowed to submit 1-in-10 pieces of content from the same domain. This was in response to folks who would show up on Reddit, not know their way around, and submit every piece of content from their blog. We only had one community then, and this behavior was considered rude at best, and spam at worst. Keep in mind we had only links back then as well.\n\nSkip ahead to today, we have many thousands of communities, proper spam prevention, and a massive userbase to curate good content. More than 60% of the content on Reddit exists in self posts. The users who create original, unique, relevant content off-site would be huge on Reddit if their content was in text posts hosted on Reddit instead. The only difference is in hosting. Profile pages are intended to be hosting for these users.\n\nI was talking to a friend the other night who writes a blog dedicated to news for our neighborhood. It's great content, it would be right at home in a couple of places on Reddit. She is a writer, not a social media expert. I think it's unfair that in addition to creating good content we expect her to source nine other things from around the web so her stuff will be seen by the audience that will probably like it (I'm speaking on behalf of these communities. I'm a part of them). With new profile pages, she can submit her stuff to her profile, and if the relevant communities like it, they can crosspost it in. If they don't, she can build her own following on her profile. The end result is the can write and post without being treated like a spammer.\n\nHope this gives a little more context to what we're trying to build.",

What we're missing that we believe makes this feature more cohesive are privacy controls, smart comment display (most reddit original content are in comments), and x-posting as a first-class feature (e.g. u/shitty_watercolour can post to his profile and he or others can x-post in r/comics or r/funny or whatever).

Go seems to have the right balance of real-word practicality, modern features, and a Python-like feeling of coherence when you finally get it right.",

Since the beginning of Reddit, our product design philosophy has been to cram as much content into view as possible, our thinking being that it increases the odds that a user will see something they like. In our native mobile apps, we use a card view, which basically shows one piece of content at a time. Interestingly enough, engagement in the native apps is approximately 4x higher than the desktop.\n\nI see this in my own usage as well. I go through a ton more content on mobile than I do on desktop. This could be because everything is pre-expanded or because the apps have infinite scroll. We'll test these things thoroughly before deploying to a wide audience, of course, but it goes to show that our intuition isn't always correct.",

I left because I wanted to try something else. I started Hipmunk in 2010 with another buddy, Adam Goldstein. He was the CEO and I was the CTO. I worked on Hipmunk for the next five years, learning many important lessons and unlearned many bad habits I had developed at Reddit. Meanwhile, Reddit continued to grow, eventually spinning out from Conde in 2012, and raising more money towards the end of 2014.\n\nReddit went through some hard times (yadda yadda yadda...), and in July of 2015, I returned as CEO.",

I believe in many ways that Reddit is the online reflection of humanity, and we want to preserve that. However, we also feel obligated to take steps to prevent real-world harm to people and to protect Reddit itself. Often, this puts us in a position of having to make some very difficult decisions.\n\n&gt; do you agree with the statement \"Subreddits should be banned if they make reddit look bad, even if they are technically legal.\"?\n\nNo, but the inverse isn't true either.\n\n&gt; Does reddit thinks about adding a \"nsfl\" button?\n\nYes. That was an alternative name suggestion to quarantining, incidentally. Our work isn't done in this department.\n\n&gt; What do you think?\n\nTotally on board.",

Filling someone\u2019s inbox with PMs saying, \u201cKill yourself\u201d is harassment. Calling someone stupid on a public forum is not.\n\n4. It\u2019s an impossible concept to achieve\n\n5. Yes. The whole point of this exercise is to consolidate and clarify our policies.\n\n6. The Report button, /r/reddit.com modmail, contact@reddit.com (in that order). We\u2019ll be doing a lot of work in the coming weeks to help our community managers respond quickly. Yes, if you can identify harassment of others, please report it.\n\nBrigading\n\n1. Mocking and calling people stupid is not harassment. Doxxing, following users around, flooding their inbox with trash is.\n\n2. I have lots of ideas here. This is a technology problem I know we can solve. Sorry for the lack of specifics, but we\u2019ll keep these tactics close to our chest for now.\n\nRelated\n\n1. The content creators one is an issue I\u2019d like to leave to the moderators. Beyond this, if it\u2019s submitted with a script, it\u2019s spam.\n\n2. While we didn\u2019t *create* reddit to be a bastion of free speech, the concept is important to us. /r/creepshots forced us to confront these issues in a way we hadn\u2019t done before. Although I wasn\u2019t at Reddit at the time, I agree with their decision to ban those communities.\n\n3. The main things we need to implement is the other type of NSFW classification, which isn\u2019t too difficult.\n\n4. No, we\u2019ve been debating non-stop since I arrived here, and will continue to do so. Many people in this thread have made good points that we\u2019ll incorporate into our policy. Clearly defining Harassment is the most obvious example.\n\n5. I know. It was frustrating for me to watch as an outsider as well. Now that I\u2019m here, I\u2019m looking forward to moving forward and improving things.\n",

I'm not going to come in and remove a bunch of features you depend on, but rather to add more tools so clumsy things like shadowbanning aren't necessary. This is going to require some tech cleverness, but I know we can do it because I've done stuff like this plenty of times before.\n\nI have a lot of ideas. We'll try them out. If things improve, we proceed, if they do not, we try something else. My goal is for you all to spend way less time doing mundane things like tracking down trolls, removing spam, arguing with idiots, etc.\n\nMy other goal is to remove some of the mystery from how communities are managed from the reader's perspective. Seeing people cry \"censorship\" every time a spammer is caught doesn't do anyone any favors. \n\n(I'm x-posting this in the other mod subreddits)\n\nedit: added the first sentence.",

It's a work-in-progress.\n\n&gt; ITA's Google powered matrix search tool has some nice features. When I need a search that hipmunk can't do, that's where I go.\n\nWe added support for routing language queries, which might help. [Check it out](http://blog.hipmunk.com/post/12563561565/new-specify-flights-by-airlines-or-connection-cities).\n\n&gt; hipmunk's searches seem to take longer than other websites. I have no data to back this up, it's just my impression.\n\nWe don't show the flights as they load one-by-one, so that could be a factor. International queries definitely take longer because we have to hit many more people for coverage. This will improve in the relatively near future.\n\n&gt; Your search tabs...they don't work 100% of the time. I often lose a few tabs during any search session. Often the 3rd, 4th or 5th tab will go missing in Chrome.\n\nWhat you're saying is your screen isn't 5000px wide. Buy some more monitors, my friend. Also, we'll improve that down the road.",

With the DMCA, we at least have a chance to right the wrong, or organize a counter-argument. It means we don't have to waste tons of resources to detect copyrighted materials. It also means that if you all post the HD-DVD key over and over, we don't have to take it down until explicitly asked. It does mean, however, that when we are explicitly asked, we must do it right away.\n\nHow you actually feel about copyright law/DRM is a totally separate issue.

We at reddit no longer have the time to babysit new communities and nurture their growth, so we're pretty impressed with the effort qgyh2 has put into this and its result.\n\nOur mission when we released the user-created reddits feature was for users to be able to make their own reddits and run them as they please. If they want to create reddits for a specific topic and moderate them heavily, that's fine. If they want to leave it as a free-for-all like \"reddit.com,\" that's also fine with us.

It's a little tricky to implement, but I don't think anyone would argue that the end result wouldn't be pretty cool.\n\n&gt; Also, would it not make more sense to use something like libsvm like/dislike hyperplane projections in the Recommender algorithms than using Graham-Schmidt for orthogonalizing feature vectors and just returning them to the user?\n\nYes, probably. Again, we just haven't spent time on the recommender in a while. Let me know when you're finished rewriting it and we can go from there :)\n\n\n",

The current reddit assumes users are aware of social news, understand voting to rank links, and are proactive enough to look for a comments button. Those are dangerous assumptions that have hindered us for years.\n\nI understand users are going to be upset, but I believe that will pass. I've been using the interface for the last few weeks, and I miss it whenever I go back to the main reddit. I hated the first beta we put up, and we kept tweaking things until we found something that improved things for us and was more friendly to new users.\n\nOf course, nothing is set in stone, and we'll keep fiddling with things.

Unfortunately, I gave in on this issue and create the politics reddit, which led many to believe that user-created reddits are a poor man's tags.\n\nThe solution to the issue (the issue being all the in-fighting on what belongs where), is to better convey the notion that reddits should be considered in the same realm as newsgroups.\n\nBecause reddits are newsgroups, I don't think some sort meta-moderating is really appropriate. Users can belong to the communities that suit them and submit links to whatever range of topics interests that community. In my opinion, a small amount of politics should be tolerated on reddit.com (the reddit itself) because reddit.com has always had some politics. The 'politics' reddit is for the community of users who want everything politics.\n\nIf you think of reddits as newsgroups, it becomes more clear how reddits and tags can co-exist. The reason I haven't been in a rush to implement tagging is that no one seems to be asking for tags to organize links for themselves. They seem instead to want tags so some sort of negative filter will work, which of course is a faulty assumption.",

Unfortunately, it's been a long time coming, and I apologize.\r\n\r\nI've never been a fan of using tagging either, however. The trouble is tags are fairly personal: what I call \"politics\" you call \"left-wing drivel.\" That and the fact that no one would actually tag a link about politics as \"politics,\" even though that's what we really want.\r\n\r\nTo get around this issue, the solution we've been talking about is having a (short) list of defined tags. Whether this works for topics, I'm not sure, but it would be definitely useful for other meta information: spam, pic, nsfw, video, pdf, dupe, etc.\r\n\r\nFor topics, a user-controlled list of available topics would be cool. When you submit, you'd see a list of popular content categories from which to choose (science, politics, blah). We'd need the ability to repair mis-taggings and abuse as well, and to grow the list.

            "selftext": "[A few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/), we committed to closing the gap between our values and our policies to explicitly address hate. After talking extensively with mods, outside organizations, and our own teams, we\u2019re updating our content policy today and enforcing it (with your help). \n\n## First, a quick recap\n\nSince our last post, here\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing:\n\n* **We brought on a** [**new Board member**](https://redditblog.com/2020/06/10/reddit-welcomes-michael-seibel-to-board-of-directors/).\n* **We held policy calls with mods**\u2014both from established Mod Councils and from communities disproportionately targeted with hate\u2014and discussed areas where we can do better to action bad actors, clarify our policies, make mods' lives easier, and concretely reduce hate.\n   * You can find [detailed notes from our All-Council mod call here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/hi3nkr/the_mod_conversations_that_went_into_todays), including specific product work we discussed.\n* **We developed our enforcement plan**, including both our immediate actions (e.g., today\u2019s bans) and long-term investments (tackling the most critical work discussed in our mod calls, sustainably enforcing the new policies, and advancing Reddit\u2019s community governance).\n\nFrom our conversations with mods and outside experts, it\u2019s clear that while we\u2019ve gotten better in some areas\u2014like actioning violations at the community level, [scaling enforcement efforts](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/hbiuas/reddit_security_report_june_18_2020/), measurably reducing hateful experiences like harassment [year over year](https://www.adl.org/online-hate-2020#results)\u2014we still have a long way to go to address the gaps in our policies and enforcement to date.\n\nThese include addressing questions our policies have left unanswered (like whether hate speech is allowed or even protected on Reddit), aspects of our product and mod tools that are still too easy for individual bad actors to abuse (inboxes, chats, modmail), and areas where we can do better to partner with our mods and communities who want to combat the same hateful conduct we do.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. In the near term, this support will translate into some of the product work we discussed with mods. But it starts with dealing squarely with the hate we can mitigate today through our policies and enforcement.\n\n## New Policy\n\nThis is the [new content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). Here\u2019s what\u2019s different:\n\n* It starts with a statement of our vision for Reddit and our communities, including the basic expectations we have for all communities and users.\n* **Rule 1** explicitly states that communities and users that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.\n   * There is an expanded definition of what constitutes a violation of this rule, along with specific examples, in our [Help Center article](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or). \n* **Rule 2** ties together our previous rules on prohibited behavior with an ask to abide by community rules and post with authentic, personal interest.\n   * Debate and creativity are welcome, but spam and malicious attempts to interfere with other communities are not.\n* The other rules are the same in spirit but have been rewritten for clarity and inclusiveness.\n\nAlongside the change to the content policy, we are initially banning about 2000 subreddits, the vast majority of which are inactive. Of these communities, about [200](https://www.redditstatic.com/banned-subreddits-june-2020.txt) have more than 10 daily users. Both r/The_Donald and r/ChapoTrapHouse were included.\n\nAll communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith. We banned r/The_Donald because it has not done so, despite every opportunity. The community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average (Rule 1), antagonized us and other communities (Rules 2 and 8), and its mods have refused to meet our most basic expectations. Until now, we\u2019ve worked in good faith to help them preserve the community as a space for its users\u2014through warnings, mod changes, quarantining, and more. \n\nThough smaller, r/ChapoTrapHouse was banned for similar reasons: They consistently host rule-breaking content and their mods have demonstrated no intention of reining in their community.\n\nTo be clear, views across the political spectrum are allowed on Reddit\u2014but all communities must work within our policies and do so in good faith, without exception.\n\n## Our commitment\n\nOur policies will never be perfect, with new edge cases that inevitably lead us to evolve them in the future. And as users, you will always have more context, community vernacular, and cultural values to inform the standards set within your communities than we as site admins or any AI ever could.\n\nBut just as our content moderation cannot scale effectively without your support, you need more support from us as well, and we admit we have fallen short towards this end. We are committed to working with you to combat the bad actors, abusive behaviors, and toxic communities that undermine our mission and get in the way of the creativity, discussions, and communities that bring us all to Reddit in the first place. We hope that our progress towards this commitment, with today\u2019s update and those to come, makes Reddit a place you enjoy and are proud to be a part of for many years to come.",

I want to take responsibility for the history of our policies over the years that got us here, and we still have work to do.**\n\nAfter watching people across the country mourn and demand an end to centuries of murder and violent discrimination against Black people, I wanted to speak out. I wanted to do this both as a human being, who sees this grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the color of my skin, and as someone who literally has a platform and, with it, a duty to speak out.\n\nEarlier this week, I wrote an email to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond. When we shared it, many of the responses said something like, \u201cHow can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?\u201d\n\nThese questions, which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart, are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company, and what you see in our content policy. \n\nOver the last fifteen years, hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities\u2014across a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could\u2019ve imagined when we first created subreddits\u2014and the kinds of content and conversations that keep people coming back day after day. It's why we come to Reddit as users, as mods, and as employees who want to bring this sort of community and belonging to the world and make it better daily.\n\nHowever, as Reddit has grown, alongside much good, it is facing its own challenges around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:\n\n* Parts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily, despite the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement. \n* Users and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to where we as administrators stand on racism. \n* Our moderators are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies that they help us enforce.\n\nWe are already working to fix these problems, and this is a promise for more urgency. Our current [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects, it\u2019s served us well. Under it, we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said, we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do, articulates none of the values behind the rules, and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.\n\nWe will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to, a statement on hate, the context for the rules, and a principle that Reddit isn\u2019t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through, and while we will move quickly, I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement, the timeline is weeks, not months.\n\nAnd just this morning, Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing), my Reddit cofounder, announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate, a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he\u2019s done for us over the years.\n\nAt the risk of making this unreadably long, I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions, we have fallen short.\n\nIn the early days of Reddit, 2005\u20132006, our idealistic \u201cpolicy\u201d was that, excluding spam, we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested, we [banned racist users](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3) anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs, despite our \u201cpolicy.\u201d \n\nI left Reddit from 2010\u20132015. During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit\u2019s no-removal policy [ossified](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/) and its content policy took [no position on hate](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/). \n\nWhen I returned in 2015, my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like r/CoonTown, which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what\u2019s acceptable on Reddit and what\u2019s not. [We banned that community and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/) because they were \u201cmaking Reddit worse\u201d but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our [2015 policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/), [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/), [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/) (and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful communities. \n\nWhile we dealt with many communities themselves, we still did not provide the clarity\u2014and it showed, both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said [racism is not against the rules, but also isn\u2019t welcome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/). This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.\n\nThis inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with r/the_donald, a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies, \u201cBreaking Reddit\u201d was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit, and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly, we should have quarantined it sooner.\n\nThe majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism, which makes us proud, and is evidence why a [community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20191016/110075/HHRG-116-IF16-Wstate-HuffmanS-20191016.pdf). That said, this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this. \n\nDespite making significant progress over the years, we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter, and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.\n\nI will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual, but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.\n\nThanks,\n\nSteve",

I\u2019ll stick around to answer your questions about the report (and other topics) in the comments.**\n\nHi all,\n\nIt\u2019s that time of year again when we share Reddit\u2019s annual transparency report.\n\nWe share this report each year because you have a right to know how user data is being managed by Reddit, and how it\u2019s both shared and not shared with government and non-government parties. \n\nYou\u2019ll find information on content removed from Reddit and requests for user information. This year, we\u2019ve expanded the report to include new data\u2014specifically, a breakdown of content policy removals, content manipulation removals, subreddit removals, and subreddit quarantines.\n\n## By the numbers\n\nSince the [full report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2019) is rather long, I\u2019ll call out a few stats below:\n\n**ADMIN REMOVALS**\n\n* In 2019, we removed **\\~53M** pieces of content in total, mostly for spam and content manipulation (e.g. brigading and vote cheating), exclusive of legal/copyright removals, which we track separately.\n* For [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) violations, we removed\n   * **222k** **pieces of content**, \n   * **55.9k accounts**, and\n   * **21.9k** **subreddits** (**87%** of which were removed for being unmoderated). \n* Additionally, we quarantined **256 subreddits**.\n\n**LEGAL REMOVALS**\n\n* Reddit received **110 requests** from government entities to remove content, of which we complied with **37.3%**.\n* In 2019 we removed about **5x more** content for copyright infringement than in 2018, largely due to copyright notices for adult-entertainment and notices targeting pieces of content that had already been removed.\n\n**REQUESTS FOR USER INFORMATION**\n\n* We received a total of **772 requests** for user account information from law enforcement and government entities.\n   * **366** of these were emergency disclosure requests, mostly from US law enforcement (**68%** of which we complied with).\n   * **406** were non-emergency requests (**73%** of which we complied with); most were US subpoenas.\n   * Reddit received an additional **224 requests** to temporarily preserve certain user account information (**86%** of which we complied with).\n* Note: We carefully review each request for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If we determine that a request is not legally valid, Reddit will challenge or reject it. (You can read more in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy) and [Guidelines for Law Enforcement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/guidelines-for-law-enforcement).)\n\n## While I have your attention...\n\nI\u2019d like to share an update about our thinking around quarantined communities.\n\nWhen we [expanded our quarantine policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/), we created an appeals process for sanctioned communities. One of the goals was to \u201cforce subscribers to reconsider their behavior and incentivize moderators to make changes.\u201d While the policy attempted to hold moderators more accountable for enforcing healthier rules and norms, it didn\u2019t address the role that each member plays in the health of their community.\n\nToday, we\u2019re making an update to address this gap: Users who consistently upvote policy-breaking content within quarantined communities will receive automated warnings, followed by further consequences like a temporary or permanent suspension. We hope this will encourage healthier behavior across these communities.\n\n## If you\u2019ve read this far\n\nIn addition to this report, we share news throughout the year from teams across Reddit, and if you like posts about what we\u2019re doing, you can stay up to date and talk to our teams in r/RedditSecurity, r/ModNews, r/redditmobile, and r/changelog.\n\n**As usual, I\u2019ll be sticking around to answer your questions in the comments.

We value your privacy and believe you have a right to know how data is being managed by Reddit and how it is shared (and not shared) with governmental and non-governmental parties.\n\nWe\u2019ve included a breakdown of requests from governmental entities worldwide and from private parties from within the United States. The most common types of requests are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. In 2018, Reddit received a total of 581 requests to produce user account information from both United States and foreign governmental entities, which represents a 151% increase from the year before. We scrutinize all requests and object when appropriate, and we didn\u2019t disclose any information for 23% of the requests. We received 28 requests from foreign government authorities for the production of user account information and did not comply with any of those requests.\n\nThis year, we expanded the report to included details on two additional types of content removals: those taken by us at Reddit, Inc., and those taken by subreddit moderators (including Automod actions). We remove content that is in violation of our site-wide policies, but subreddits often have additional rules specific to the [purpose, tone, and norms of their community](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~sjhaver3/The-internets-hidden-rules-cscw2018.pdf). You can now see the breakdown of these two types of takedowns for a more holistic view of company and community actions.\n\nIn other news, you may have heard that we closed an additional round of funding this week, which gives us more runway and will help us continue to improve our platform. What else does this mean for you? Not much. Our strategy and governance model remain the same. And\u2014of course\u2014we do not share specific user data with any investor, new or old.\n\nI\u2019ll hang around for a while to answer your questions. \n\n\u2013Steve",

Nevertheless, we will continue to fight for the open internet (and occasionally pester you with posts encouraging you to fight for it, too).\n\nWe also had a lot of fun fighting for the *not-so-free* but perfectly balanced world of r/thanosdidnothingwrong. I\u2019m always amazed to see redditors so engaged with their communities that they get [Snoo tattoos](https://www.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/comments/8zcga8/perfectly_balanced_as_all_things_should_be/). \n\nSpeaking of bans, you\u2019ve probably noticed that over the past few months we\u2019ve banned a few subreddits and [quarantined](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/) several more. We don't take the banning of subreddits lightly, but we will continue to enforce our policies (and be transparent with all of you when we make changes to them) and use other tools to encourage a healthy ecosystem for communities. We\u2019ve been investing heavily in our Anti-Evil and Trust &amp; Safety teams, as well as a new team devoted solely to investigating and preventing efforts to interfere with our site, state-sponsored and otherwise. We also recognize the ways that redditors themselves actively help flag potential suspicious actors, and we\u2019re working on a system to allow you all to [report directly to this team](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/9hjkv5/so_about_those_suspicious_activity_reports/).\n\nOn the product side, our teams have been hard at work shipping countless updates to our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=reddit+Inc.&amp;hl=en) apps, like universal search and News. We\u2019ve also expanded Chat on mobile and desktop and launched an opt-in subreddit chat, which we\u2019ve already seen communities using for game-day discussions and chats about TV shows. We started testing out a new hub for [OC (Original Content)](https://www.reddit.com/original) and a [Save Drafts feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8k8d1x/beta_new_save_draft_feature_for_text_and_link/) (with shared drafts as well) for text and link posts in the redesign. \n\nSpeaking of which, we\u2019ve made a ton of improvements to the redesign since we last talked about it in April. \n\nIncluding but not limited to\u2026 night mode, user &amp; post flair improvements, [better traffic pages for ](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/)\n\n[mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/), accessibility improvements, keyboard shortcuts, a bunch of new community widgets, fixing key AutoMod integrations, and the ability to [have community styling show up on mobile as well](https://i.redd.it/l12cv7lqmwf11.png), which was one of the main reasons why we took on the redesign in the first place. I know you all have had a lot of feedback since we first launched it ([I have too](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8d8qws/despite_everyone_saying_the_redesign_is_perfect/)). Our teams have poured a tremendous amount of work into shipping improvements, and their #1 focus now is on improving performance. If you haven\u2019t checked it out in a while, I encourage you to [give it a spin](http://new.reddit.com/).\n\nLast but not least, on the community front, we just wrapped our second annual Moderator Thank You Roadshow, where the rest of the admins and I got the chance to meet mods in different cities, have [a bit of fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/8u5cca/quick_while_we_are_all_at_the_game/), and chat about Reddit. We also launched a new [Mod Help Center](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/9bnj3a/we_launched_a_new_knowledge_base_for_mods_and_we/) and new mod tools for Chat and the redesign, with more fun stuff (like Modmail Search) on the way.\n\nOther than that, I can\u2019t imagine we have much to talk about, but I\u2019ll hang to around some questions anyway.\n\n\u2014spez",

This year, our annual post happens to coincide with one of the biggest national discussions of privacy online and the integrity of the platforms we use, so I wanted to share a more in\\-depth update in an effort to be as transparent with you all as possible.\n\nFirst, here is our [2017 Transparency Report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report). This details government and law\\-enforcement requests for private information about our users. The types of requests we receive most often are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. We require all of these requests to be legally valid, and we push back against those we don\u2019t consider legally justified. In 2017, we received significantly more requests to produce or preserve user account information. The percentage of requests we deemed to be legally valid, however, [decreased slightly for both types of requests](https://i.redditmedia.com/pFVOHUupWLqk_MRNKJVgGzuKhSXkN4j0xym2LCdlnrU.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=28bc738a240d9a7b240e6c54e7955eb3). \\(You\u2019ll find a full breakdown of these stats, as well as non\\-governmental requests and DMCA takedown notices, in the report. You can find our transparency reports from previous years [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/).\\) \n\nWe also participated in a number of amicus briefs, joining other tech companies in support of issues we care about. In Hassell v. Bird and Yelp v. Superior Court \\(Montagna\\), we argued for the right to defend a user's speech and anonymity if the user is sued. And this year, we've advocated for upholding the net neutrality rules \\(County of Santa Clara v. FCC\\) and defending user anonymity against unmasking prior to a lawsuit \\(Glassdoor v. Andra Group, LP\\).\n\nI\u2019d also like to give an update to my last post about the [investigation into Russian attempts to exploit Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/827zqc/in_response_to_recent_reports_about_the_integrity/). I\u2019ve mentioned before that we\u2019re cooperating with Congressional inquiries. In the spirit of transparency, we\u2019re going to share with you what we shared with them earlier today:\n\nIn my post last month, I described that we had found and removed a few hundred accounts that were of suspected Russian Internet Research Agency origin. I\u2019d like to share with you more fully what that means. At this point in our investigation, we have found 944 suspicious accounts, few of which had a visible impact on the site: \n\n* 70&amp;#37; \\(662\\) had zero karma\n* 1&amp;#37; \\(8\\) had negative karma\n* 22&amp;#37; \\(203\\) had 1\\-999 karma\n* 6&amp;#37; \\(58\\) had 1,000\\-9,999 karma\n* 1&amp;#37; \\(13\\) had a karma score of 10,000\\+\n\nOf the 282 accounts with non\\-zero karma, more than half \\(145\\) were banned prior to the start of this investigation through our routine Trust &amp; Safety practices. All of these bans took place before the 2016 election and in fact, all but 8 of them took place back in 2015. This general pattern also held for the accounts with significant karma: of the 13 accounts with 10,000\\+ karma, 6 had already been banned prior to our investigation\u2014all of them before the 2016 election. Ultimately, we have seven accounts with significant karma scores that made it past our defenses.\n\nAnd as I mentioned last time, our investigation did not find any election\\-related advertisements of the nature found on other platforms, through either our self\\-serve or managed advertisements. I also want to be very clear that none of the 944 users placed any ads on Reddit. We also did not detect any effective use of these accounts to engage in vote manipulation. \n\nTo give you more insight into our findings, [here is a link to all 944 accounts](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/suspiciousaccounts). We have decided to keep them visible for now, but after a period of time the accounts and their content will be removed from Reddit. We are doing this to allow moderators, investigators, and all of you to see their account histories for yourselves.\n\nWe still have a lot of room to improve, and we intend to remain vigilant. Over the past several months, our teams have evaluated our site\\-wide protections against fraud and abuse to see where we can make those improvements. But I am pleased to say that these investigations have shown that the efforts of our Trust &amp; Safety and Anti\\-Evil teams are working. It\u2019s also a tremendous testament to the work of our moderators and the healthy skepticism of our communities, which make Reddit a difficult platform to manipulate.\n\nWe know the success of Reddit is dependent on [your trust](https://www.reddit.com/r/CircleofTrust/comments/89slln/lets_see_if_you_can_hold_off_betraying_long/). We hope continue to build on that by communicating openly with you about these subjects, now and in the future. Thanks for reading.

            "selftext": "In the past couple of weeks, Reddit has been mentioned as one of the platforms used to promote Russian propaganda. As it\u2019s an ongoing investigation, we have been relatively quiet on the topic publicly, which I know can be frustrating. While transparency is important, we also want to be careful to not tip our hand too much while we are investigating. We take the integrity of Reddit extremely seriously, both as the stewards of the site and as Americans.\n\nGiven the recent news, we\u2019d like to share some of what we\u2019ve learned:\n\nWhen it comes to Russian influence on Reddit, there are three broad areas to discuss: ads, direct propaganda from Russians, indirect propaganda promoted by our users.\n\nOn the first topic, ads, there is not much to share. We don\u2019t see a lot of ads from Russia, either before or after the 2016 election, and what we do see are mostly ads promoting spam and ICOs.  Presently, ads from Russia are blocked entirely, and all ads on Reddit are reviewed by humans. Moreover, our [ad policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/advertising/policy-and-guidelines/reddit-advertising-policy) prohibit content that depicts intolerant or overly contentious political or cultural views.\n\nAs for direct propaganda, that is, content from accounts we suspect are of Russian origin or content linking directly to known propaganda domains, we are doing our best to identify and remove it. We have found and removed a few hundred accounts, and of course, every account we find expands our search a little more. The vast majority of suspicious accounts we have found in the past months were banned back in 2015\u20132016 through our enhanced efforts to prevent abuse of the site generally.\n\nThe final case, indirect propaganda, is the most complex. For example, the Twitter account @TEN\\_GOP is now known to be a Russian agent. @TEN\\_GOP\u2019s Tweets were amplified by thousands of Reddit users, and sadly, from everything we can tell, these users are mostly American, and appear to be unwittingly promoting Russian propaganda. I believe the biggest risk we face as Americans is our own ability to discern reality from nonsense, and this is a burden we all bear.\n\nI wish there was a solution as simple as banning all propaganda, but it\u2019s not that easy. Between truth and fiction are a thousand shades of grey. It\u2019s up to all of us\u2014Redditors, citizens, journalists\u2014to work through these issues. It\u2019s somewhat ironic, but I actually believe what we\u2019re going through right now will actually reinvigorate Americans to be more vigilant, hold ourselves to higher standards of discourse, and fight back against propaganda, whether foreign or not.\n\nThank you for reading. While I know it\u2019s frustrating that we don\u2019t share everything we know publicly, I want to reiterate that we take these matters very seriously, and we are cooperating with congressional inquiries. We are growing more sophisticated by the day, and we remain open to suggestions and feedback for how we can improve.",

If you haven\u2019t tried the app in a while, please check it out! \n\nWe added a ton of new features to Reddit, from spoiler tags and post\\-to\\-profile to chat \\(now in beta for individuals and groups\\), and we\u2019re especially pleased to see features that didn\u2019t exist a year ago like crossposts and native video on our front pages every day.\n\nNot every launch has gone swimmingly, and while we may not respond to everything directly, we do see and read all of your feedback. We rarely get things right the first time \\(profile pages, anybody?\\), but we\u2019re still working on these features and we\u2019ll do our best to continue improving Reddit for everybody. If you\u2019d like to participate and follow along with every change, subscribe to r/announcements \\(major announcements\\), r/beta \\(long\\-running tests\\), r/modnews \\(moderator features\\), and r/changelog \\(most everything else\\).\n\nI\u2019m particularly proud of how far our Community, Trust &amp; Safety, and Anti\\-Evil teams have come. We\u2019ve steadily shifted the balance of our work from reactive to proactive, which means that much more often we\u2019re catching issues before they become issues. I\u2019d like to highlight one stat in particular: at the beginning of 2017 our T&amp;S work was almost entirely driven by user reports. Today, more than half of the users and content we action are caught by us proactively using more sophisticated modeling. Often we catch policy violations before being reported or even seen by users or mods.\n\nThe greater Reddit community does something incredible every day. In fact, one of the lessons I\u2019ve learned from Reddit is that when people are in the right context, they are more creative, collaborative, supportive, and funnier than we sometimes give ourselves credit for \\(I\u2019m serious!\\). A couple great examples from last year include that time you all created an [artistic masterpiece](https://redditblog.com/2017/04/18/place-part-two/) and that other time you all organized [site\\-wide grassroots campaigns](https://redditblog.com/2017/12/11/an-analysis-of-net-neutrality-activism-on-reddit/) for net neutrality. Well done, everybody.\n\nIn 2018, we\u2019ll continue our efforts to make Reddit welcoming. Our biggest project continues to be the web redesign. We know you have a lot of questions, so our teams will be doing a series of blog posts and AMAs all about the redesign, starting soon\\-ish in r/blog. \n\nIt\u2019s still in alpha with a few thousand users testing it every day, but we\u2019re excited about the progress we\u2019ve made and looking forward to expanding our testing group to more users. \\(Thanks to all of you who have offered your feedback so far!\\) If you\u2019d like to join in the fun, we pull testers from r/beta. We\u2019ll be dramatically increasing the number of testers soon.\n\nWe\u2019re super excited about 2018. The staff and I will hang around to answer questions for a bit.\n\nHappy New Year,\n\nSteve and the Reddit team\n\nupdate: I'm off for now. As always, thanks for the feedback and questions.",

It was inspiring to witness [organic takeovers](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7j8fkt/an_analysis_of_net_neutrality_activism_on_reddit/) of the front page \\(twice\\), read touching [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) about how net neutrality matters in users\u2019 everyday lives, see bills about net neutrality [discussed on the front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/7j6kn4/congress_has_set_out_a_bill_to_stop_the_fcc/) \\(with over 100,000 upvotes and cross-posts to over 100 communities\\), and watch redditors exercise their voices as citizens in the [hundreds of thousands of calls](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2017/11/22/reddit-net-neutrality-fcc-protest/) they drove to Congress.\n\nIt is disappointing that the FCC Chairman plowed ahead with his planned repeal despite all of this [public concern](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/12/this-poll-gave-americans-a-detailed-case-for-and-against-the-fccs-net-neutrality-plan-the-reaction-among-republicans-was-striking/?hpid=hp_hp-cards_hp-card-technology%3Ahomepage%2Fcard&amp;utm_term=.d11780a12cc2), not to mention the [objections expressed by his fellow commissioners](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/12/16766324/fcc-commissioners-clyburn-rosenworcel-net-neutrality), [the FCC\u2019s own CTO](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/13/net-neutrality-repeal-warning-eric-burger-fcc-259968), [more than a hundred members of Congress](https://doyle.house.gov/sites/doyle.house.gov/files/documents/20171213DoyleNDelayLtrAll.pdf), [dozens of senators, and the very builders of the modern internet](https://www.salon.com/2017/12/12/senators-internet-pioneers-pen-letters-to-fcc-asking-to-cancel-thursdays-net-neutrality-vote/). \n\nNevertheless, today\u2019s vote is the beginning, not the end. While the fight to preserve net neutrality is going to be longer than we had hoped, this is far from over.\n\nMany of you have asked what comes next. We don\u2019t exactly know yet, but it seems likely that the FCC\u2019s decision will be challenged in court soon, and we would be supportive of that challenge. It\u2019s also possible that Congress can decide to take up the cause and create strong, enforceable net neutrality rules that aren\u2019t subject to the political winds at the FCC. Nevertheless, this will be a complex process that takes time.\n\nWhat is certain is that Reddit will continue to be involved in this issue in the way that we know best: seeking out every opportunity to amplify your voices and share them with those who have the power to make a difference. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the outcome we wanted, but you should all be proud of the awareness you\u2019ve created. Those who thought that they\u2019d be able to quietly repeal net neutrality without anyone noticing or caring learned a thing or two, and we still may come out on top of this yet. We\u2019ll keep you informed as things develop.\n\nu\\/arabscarab \\(Jessica, our head of policy\\) will also be in the comments to address your questions. \n\n\u2014u\\/spez &amp; u\\/kn0thing\n\nupdate: Please note the FCC is not united in this decision and find the dissenting statements from commissioners [Clyburn and Rosenworcel](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16776712/fcc-commissioners-democrat-statements-net-neutrality).\n\nupdate2 (9:55AM pst): While the vote has not technically happened, we decided to post after the two dissenting commissioners released their statements.

            "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nIf you spent any time on Reddit last week, you [may have noticed a common theme](https://i.redditmedia.com/IhvWlif94HFLCRp0uNqDNjOEsSn2IdI6NVm-OaNnYvM.png?s=2fe8fbb8cd76df11a24f8a105e8a8fae) in the posts on your front page, so we wanted to take a moment to recap what\u2019s happened so far in the fight for net neutrality, underscore how important this issue is to Reddit, and share how we plan to continue to stand up for an internet that remains open and free.\n\nOn Tuesday, FCC chairman Ajit Pai [announced his intention to vote on a full rollback of the 2015 net neutrality rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7ej943/fcc_announces_plan_to_repeal_net_neutrality/). While the pre-Thanksgiving timing of the announcement might have helped the news sneak by over the holidays, you all have helped prevent that from happening. Aside from ensuring that net neutrality was discussed IRL around Thanksgiving tables across the country, you brought the conversation about the open internet to almost every community on the site, from r/dataisbeautiful to r/trashpandas. You\u2019ve made [high-quality gifs](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/7eklnu/when_i_hear_net_neutrality_is_under_fire_again/), flooded [the meme market](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/7eqxtf/ea_memes_and_fcc_memes_have_a_quick_return_of/), explained the issue to people who are [out of the loop](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/7elxew/whats_going_on_with_net_neutrality_ask_all_your/), and [given a history](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/7elqw7/redditor_lists_all_the_times_ipss_have_illegally/) of why net neutrality rules are essential. \n\nIn just one week, you made 50,000 unique posts and over 350,000 comments related to net neutrality, generating over 21 million votes. While Tuesday\u2019s news hits close to home, we are grateful that the Reddit community cares just as much about net neutrality as we do at Reddit HQ.\n\nAs many of you know, the FCC\u2019s vote will happen on December 14 and is expected to pass. However, the vote is also expected to be challenged almost immediately in court, likely kicking off a long process that will take years to work through. During this time, Congress will likely try to legislate a fix. As a still-small company that owes its existence to net neutrality\u2019s giving us a fair chance in the marketplace, we will take every opportunity to share our perspective and give constructive input to this process. The [data says](https://www.scribd.com/document/353285485/Freedman-Consulting-Net-Neutrality-Poll) that Americans don\u2019t see this as a partisan issue, and neither do we.\n\nMost of the activism right now is focused on driving messages to Congress and the FCC before December 14 \\(including a protest in DC the day before the vote\\).  The FCC has received a record 22 million comments on net neutrality but has indicated they have not reviewed comments that don\u2019t introduce new facts into the record or make serious legal arguments. Additionally, they believe a number of the comments are fake. While we are unlikely to change the FCC\u2019s decision, we encourage you to follow [Commissioner Rosenworcel\u2019s suggestion](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rosenworcel-fcc-net-neutrality-repeal-20171122-story.html) and continue to \u201cmake a ruckus\u201d to let the FCC hear your individual stories on the importance of net neutrality.  \n\nA few months ago, u/kn0thing [asked you to leave comments explaining why net neutrality is important to you](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/), and thousands of you delivered. Today, we\u2019re asking you again to leave personal stories that we can use in the battle ahead. When we shared these stories with members of Congress this past July, we saw firsthand how effective they are at humanizing an issue that is too often perceived as an abstract battle between big corporate interests. \n\nWe will continue to share these personal testimonials with more members of Congress, with the media, and potentially file them in court briefs. Our goal in this effort is to keep the personal dimension of the open internet top of mind for everyone who wants to repeal net neutrality. We know how powerful redditors banding together for a common cause can be, so our focus will continue to be on amplifying *your* voices, from Capitol Hill to \u2014 if it comes to it \u2014 the Supreme Court. \n\nSo, please tell us in the comments:\n\n*How would your life change if internet service providers started blocking or throttling certain internet traffic, or creating paid prioritization channels for certain content?* \n\nInclude as much detail as you feel comfortable sharing. Generally, the more specific, the better. Mentioning your state and Congressional representative is especially useful.\n\nThank you.\n\nu/ArabScarab \\(Jessica Ashooh, our Head of Policy\\), and I will hang around to answer questions.",

The next major release of the native apps *should* make moderators happy \\(but you never know how these things will go\u2026\\).\n\nLast week we expanded our content policy to clarify our stance around violent content. The previous policy forbade \u201cinciting violence,\u201d but we found it lacking, so we expanded the policy to cover any content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against people or animals.

We believe a free and open Internet is the most important advancement of our lifetime, and its preservation is paramount. Even if the FCC chooses to disregard public opinion and rolls back existing Net Neutrality regulations, the fight for Internet freedom is far from over, and Reddit will be there. Alexis and I just returned from Washington, D.C. where we met with members and senators on both sides of the aisle and shared your [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) and passion about this issue. Thank you again for [making your voice heard](https://redditblog.com/2017/07/14/redditors-rally-on-the-day-of-action-to-save-net-neutrality/).\n\nWe\u2019re happy to report Reddit IRL is alive and well: while in D.C., we hosted one of a series of meetups around the country to connect with moderators in person, and back in June, Redditors gathered for Global Reddit Meetup Day across 120 cities worldwide. We have a few more meetups planned this year, and so far it\u2019s been great fun to connect with everyone face to face.\n\nReddit has [closed another round of funding](https://www.recode.net/2017/7/31/16037126/reddit-funding-200-million-valuation-steve-huffman-alexis-ohanian). This is an important milestone for the company, and while Reddit the business continues to grow and is healthier than ever, the additional capital provides even more resources to build a Reddit that is accessible, welcoming, broad, and available to everyone on the planet. I want to emphasize our values and goals are not changing, and our investors continue to support our mission.\n\nOn the product side, we have a lot going on. It\u2019s incredible how much we\u2019re building, and we\u2019re excited to show you over the coming months. Our video beta continues to expand.

We'll have an alpha end of August, a public beta in October, and we'll see where the feedback takes us from there.\n\nWe\u2019re making some changes to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy). Specifically, we\u2019re phasing out Do Not Track, which isn\u2019t supported by all browsers, doesn\u2019t work on mobile, and is implemented by few\u2014if any\u2014advertisers, and replacing it with our own [privacy controls](https://www.reddit.com/personalization). DNT is a nice idea, but without buy-in from the entire ecosystem, its impact is limited. In place of DNT, we're adding in new, more granular privacy controls that give you control over how Reddit uses any data we collect about you. This applies to data we collect both on and off Reddit  (some of which ad blockers don\u2019t catch). The information we collect allows us to serve you both more relevant content and ads. While there is a tension between privacy and personalization, we will continue to be upfront with you about what we collect and give you mechanisms to opt out. Changes go into effect in 30 days.\n\nOur Community, Trust &amp; Safety, and Anti-Evil teams are hitting their stride. For the first time ever, the majority of our enforcement actions last quarter were proactive instead of reactive. This means we\u2019re catching abuse earlier, and as a result we saw over 1M fewer moderator reports despite traffic increasing over the same period (speaking of which, we updated [community traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6pxyvy/traffic_page_update_now_includes_data_from_all/) numbers to be more accurate).\n\nWhile there is plenty more to report, I\u2019ll stop here. If you have any questions about the above or anything else, I\u2019ll be here a couple hours.\n\n\u2013Steve\n\nu: I've got to run for now. Thanks for the questions! I'll be back later this evening to answer some more.",

            "selftext": "Hi Mods,\n\nI wanted to follow up on the [CSS and redesign post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/66q4is/the_web_redesign_css_and_mod_tools/) from a few weeks back and provide some more information as well as clarify some questions that have emerged.\n\nBased on your feedback, we will allow you to continue to use CSS on top of the new structured styles. This will be the last part of the customization tool we build as we want to make sure the structured options we are offering are rock solid. Also, please keep in mind that if you do choose to use the advanced option, we will no longer be treading as carefully as we have done in the past about breaking styles applied through CSS^1.\n\nTo give you a sense of our approach, we\u2019re starting with a handful of highly-customized communities (e.g. r/overwatch and r/gameofthrones) and seeing how close we can get to their existing appearance using the new system. Logos, images, colors, spoilers, menus, flairs (all kinds), and lots more will be supported. I know you\u2019d like to see a list of everything, but we think the best approach will be to show instead of tell, which we\u2019re racing to as quickly as possible.\n\nThe widget system I mentioned in the last post isn\u2019t directly related. Many communities have added complex functionality over the years (calendars, scoreboards, etc). A widget system will elevate these features to first-class status on Reddit, with the aim of making them both more powerful and reuseable. Yes, we\u2019re evaluating how we would accept user-created widgets.  We intend for widgets to be able to be updated via the API, so you\u2019ll still be able to create dynamically updating content in your subreddit sidebar.\n\nThis change, and the redesign in general, is going to happen slowly.  We will will not be abruptly cutting everyone over to the new site at once.  We know it won\u2019t be perfect at first (unlike the current site), and plan to include plenty of time to solicit feedback and make iterations.  Sharing our plans for subreddit customization this far advance with you is part of this process.\n\nWe\u2019ll start with a small alpha group and create a subreddit to solicit feedback.  As we continue to add features, we\u2019ll expand the testing group to an opt-in beta.  If you\u2019d like to participate in the alpha please add a reply to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6auyq9/reddit_is_procss/dhhmebb/).  Please note, signing up does not guarantee a spot in the alpha.  We want to be able to be responsive to the alpha testers, and keeping the initial group small has proved to be effective in the past.\n\nI\u2019d like thank everyone who has provided feedback on this topic.  There have been some very [constructive](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/677rba/some_brainstorming_about_potential_widgets_in_the) [threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/66rdiy/crowdsourcing_new_subreddit_widgets/).  I\u2019d also like to take a moment to appreciate how civil the feedback has been.  This is a topic many of you feel passionate about.  Thank you for keeping things constructive.\n\nCool?\n\nCool.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^1 No snark allowed.",

            "selftext": "Hi Mods,\n\nYou may recall from my [announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5q4qmg/out_with_2016_in_with_2017/) earlier this year that I mentioned we\u2019re currently working on a full redesign of the site, which brings me to the two topics I wanted to talk to you about today: Custom Styles and Mod Tools.\n\n##**Custom Styles**\n\nCustom community styles are a key component in allowing communities to express their identity, and we want to preserve this in the site redesign. For a long time, we\u2019ve used CSS as the mechanism for subreddit customization, but we\u2019ll be deprecating CSS during the redesign in favor of a new system over the coming months. While CSS has provided a wonderful creative canvas to many communities, it is not without flaws:\n\n* It\u2019s web-only. Increasing users are viewing Reddit on mobile (over 50%), where CSS is not supported. We\u2019d love for you to be able to bring your spice to phones as well.\n* CSS is a pain in the ass: it\u2019s difficult to learn; it\u2019s error-prone; and it\u2019s time consuming.\n* Some changes cause confusion (such as changing the subscription numbers).\n* CSS causes us to move slow. We\u2019d like to make changes more quickly. You\u2019ve asked us to improve things, and one of the things that slows us down is the risk of breaking subreddit CSS (and third-party mod tools).\n\nWe\u2019re designing a new set of tools to address the challenges with CSS but continue to allow communities to express their identities. These tools will allow moderators to select customization options for key areas of their subreddit across platforms. For example, header images and flair colors will be rendered correctly on desktop and mobile.\n\nWe know great things happen when we give users as much flexibility as possible. The menu of options we\u2019ll provide for customization is still being determined. Our starting point is to replicate as many of the existing uses that already exist, and to expand beyond as we evolve.\n\nWe will also natively supporting a lot of the functionality that subreddits currently build into the sidebar via a widget system. For instance, a calendar widget will allow subreddits to easily display upcoming events. We\u2019d like this feature and many like it to be accessible to all communities.\n\nHow are we going to get there? We\u2019ll be working closely with as many of you as possible to design these features. The process will span the next few months. We have a lot of ideas already and are hoping you\u2019ll help us add and refine even more. The transition isn\u2019t going to be easy for everyone, so we\u2019ll assist communities that want help (i.e. we\u2019ll do it for you). u/powerlanguage will be reaching out for alpha testers.\n\n##**Mod Tools**\n\nMod tools have evolved over time to be some of the most complex parts of Reddit, both in terms of user experience and the underlying code.  We know that these tools are crucial for the maintaining the health of your communities, and  we know many of you who moderate very large subreddits depend on third-party tools for your work. Not breaking these tools is constantly on our mind (for better or worse).\n\nWe\u2019re in contact with the devs of Toolbox, and would like to work together to port it to the redesign. Once that is complete, we\u2019ll begin work on updating these tools, including supporting natively the most requested features from Toolbox.\n\nThe existing site and the redesigned site will run in parallel while we make these changes. That is, we don\u2019t have plans for turning off the current site anytime soon. If you depend on functionality that has not yet been transferred to the redesign, you will still have a way to perform those actions.\n\nWhile we have your attention\u2026 we\u2019re also growing our internal team that handles spam and bad-actors. Our current focus is on report abuse. We\u2019ve caught a lot of bad behavior. We hope you notice the difference, and we\u2019ll keep at it regardless.\n\n##**Moving Forward**\n\nWe know moderation can feel janitorial\u2013thankless and repetitive. Thank you for all that you do. Our goal is to take care much of that burden so you can focus on helping your communities thrive.\n\nBig changes are ahead. These are fundamental, core issues that we\u2019ll be grappling with together\u2013changes to how communities are managed and express identity are not taken lightly. We\u2019ll be giving you further details as we move forward, but wanted to give you a heads up early.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nupdate: now that I've cherry-picked all the easy questions, I'm going to take off and leave the hard ones for u/powerlanguage. I'll be back in a couple hours.",

            "selftext": "Hello Everyone,\n\nWe just posted our [2016 Transparency Report](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2016). It details government and law-enforcement-agency requests for private information about our users. We publish it each year, and you can find previous versions [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/).\n\nOur goals in publishing the report are to demonstrate Reddit\u2019s commitment to remaining a place that encourages authentic conversation and to share with you the ways in which we work to protect the privacy of our users.\n\nGenerally, the types of requests we receive are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. We require all requests to be legally valid, and, in 2016, we did not produce records in response to approximately 40% of them, which is on par with previous years.\n\nAnother way in which we stand up on behalf of users is through participation in [amicus briefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicus_curiae). Basically, we say we support a party and their position. In tech, it is one of the few areas in which many companies work together to send a strong message to courts.\n\nWe participated in a couple amicus briefs this year, including one on [behalf of Facebook](https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/In-re-381-Search-Warrants-Amicus-Brief.pdf) in the state of New York, who was served with a bulk warrant for account information, photos, private messages, and other information for 381 individuals. Reddit joined with a number of other tech companies in supporting Facebook\u2019s arguments that questioned the legal validity of the bulk search warrant and the associated gag order which prevented Facebook from notifying its users.\n\nAgain, in support of Facebook, we joined a group to fight against a Section 230 ruling in the state of California. Section 230 essentially allows platforms like Reddit to exist because it grants broad immunity to online service providers from harms arising out of third-party content. In this case, the trial court had held that Jason Cross a/k/a Michael Knight (\u201cKnight\u201d) could seek to hold Facebook liable for failing to remove third-party content that Knight found objectionable.  Amici [filed a response](http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/historical/1378/) in support of Facebook and to argue against the trial court\u2019s order finding that California right of publicity claims fall outside the broad scope of Section 230\u2019s immunity. \n\nThank you for reading. I hope that you take this report as a sign of our commitment to your privacy and trust.\n\nI\u2019ll answer any questions that I can, but please understand I can\u2019t always be completely candid when it comes to legal matters.\n\nSteve (spez)\n",

We are a completely different company than we were a year ago, having improved in just about every dimension. We hired most of the company, creating many new teams and growing the rest. As a result, we are capable of building more than ever before.\n\nLast year was our most productive ever. We shipped well-reviewed apps for both [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&amp;hl=en). It is crazy to think these apps did not exist a year ago\u2014especially considering they now account for over 40% of our content views. Despite being relatively new and not yet having all the functionality of the desktop site, the apps are fastest and best way to browse Reddit. If you haven\u2019t given them a try yet, you should definitely take them for a spin.\n\nAdditionally, we built a new web tech stack, upon which we built the long promised new version [moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/5h1j48/new_modmail_now_available_for_all_subreddits) and our [mobile website](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/58ir49/reddit_change_mobile_website_architectural_revamp/). We added [image hosting](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/) on all platforms as well, which now supports the majority of images uploaded to Reddit.\n\nWe want Reddit to be a welcoming place for all. We know we still have a long way to go, but I want to share with you some of the progress we have made. Our Anti-Evil and Trust &amp; Safety teams reduced spam by over 90%, and we released the first version of our [blocking tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4dmnn6/new_and_improved_block_user_feature_in_your_inbox/), which made a nice dent in reported abuse. In the wake of [Spezgiving](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5frg1n/tifu_by_editing_some_comments_and_creating_an/), we increased actions taken against individual bad actors by nine times. Your continued engagement helps us make the site better for everyone, thank you for that feedback.\n\nAs always, the Reddit community did many wonderful things for the world. You raised a [lot](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/5j7z3d/rcfb_buys_donates_6250_in_toys_and_cash_to_toys/) [of](https://www.donorschoose.org/reddit-gifts-for-the-teachers) [money](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtraLife/wiki/leaderboard); stepped up to help [grieving](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/5k5xjn/does_anyone_know_a_place_that_will_remove/) [families](https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/4v2jbv/odd_request_for_help_my_wife_recently_died_during/?sort=top); and even helped [diagnose](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/girl-diagnosed-rare-genetic-disorder-reddit-years-inconclusive/story?id=38876898) a rare genetic disorder. There are stories like this every day, and they are one of the reasons why we are all so proud to work here. Thank you.\n\nWe have lot upcoming this year. Some of the things we are working on right now include a new frontpage algorithm, improved performance on all platforms, and [moderation tools on mobile](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/5pxvlg/mod_tools_on_mobile_web_approveremovespam/) (native support to follow). We will publish our yearly transparency report in March.\n\nOne project I would like to preview is a rewrite of the desktop website. It is a long time coming. The desktop website has not meaningfully changed in many years; it is not particularly welcoming to new users (or old for that matter); and still runs code from the earliest days of Reddit over ten years ago. We know there are implications for community styles and various browser extensions. This is a massive project, and the transition is going to take some time. We are going to need a lot of volunteers to help with testing: new users, old users, creators, lurkers, mods, [please sign up here](https://reddit-research.typeform.com/to/TdKcop)!\n\nHere's to a happy, productive, drama-free (ha), 2017!\n\nSteve and the Reddit team\n\nupdate: I'm off for now.

We are taking a more aggressive stance against toxic users and poorly behaving communities. You can filter r/all now.\n\nHi All,\n\nI am sorry: I am sorry for compromising the trust you all have in Reddit, and I am sorry to those that I created work and stress for, particularly over the holidays. It is heartbreaking to think that my actions distracted people from their family over the holiday; instigated harassment of our moderators; and may have harmed Reddit itself, which I love more than just about anything.\n\nThe United States is more divided than ever, and we see that tension within Reddit itself. The community that was formed in support of President-elect Donald Trump organized and grew rapidly, but within it were users that devoted themselves to antagonising the broader Reddit community.\n\nMany of you are aware of my attempt to [troll the trolls](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/5eo8rq/the_donald_gets_infiltrated_by_reddits_ceo/?st=IVWNCVHU&amp;sh=a9c7a036) last week. I honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community by meeting them on their level. It did not go as planned. I restored the original comments after less than an hour, and [explained what I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ekdy9/the_admins_are_suffering_from_low_energy_have/dad5sf1/).\n\nI spent my formative years as a young troll on the Internet. I also led the team that built Reddit ten years ago, and spent years moderating the original Reddit communities, so I am as comfortable online as anyone. As CEO, I am often out in the world speaking about how Reddit is the home to conversation online, and a follow on question about harassment on our site is always asked. We have dedicated many of our resources to fighting harassment on Reddit, which is why letting one of our most engaged communities openly harass me felt hypocritical.\n\nWhile many users across the site found what I did funny, or appreciated that I was standing up to the bullies (I received plenty of support from users of r/the_donald), many others did not. I understand what I did has greater implications than my relationship with one community, and it is fair to raise the question of whether this erodes trust in Reddit. I hope our transparency around this event is an indication that we take matters of trust seriously. Reddit is no longer the little website my college roommate, u/kn0thing, and I started more than eleven years ago. It is a massive collection of communities that provides news, entertainment, and fulfillment for millions of people around the world, and I am continually humbled by what Reddit has grown into. I will never risk your trust like this again, and we are updating our internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.\n\nMore than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban the r/the_donald outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so. If there is anything about this election that we have learned, it is that there are communities that feel alienated and just want to be heard, and Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.\n\nHowever, when we separate the behavior of some of r/the_donald users from their politics, it is their behavior we cannot tolerate. The opening statement of our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) asks that we all show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy Reddit for what it is. It is my first duty to do what is best for Reddit, and the current situation is not sustainable.\n\nHistorically, we have relied on our relationship with moderators to curb bad behaviors. While some of the moderators have been helpful, this has not been wholly effective, and we are now taking a more proactive approach to policing behavior that is detrimental to Reddit:\n\n* We have identified hundreds of the most toxic users and are taking action against them, ranging from warnings to timeouts to permanent bans.\nPosts stickied on r/the_donald will no longer appear in r/all. r/all is not our frontpage, but is a popular listing that our most engaged users frequent, including myself. The sticky feature was designed for moderators to make announcements or highlight specific posts. It was not meant to circumvent organic voting, which r/the_donald does to slingshot posts into r/all, often in a manner that is antagonistic to the rest of the community.\n\n* We will continue taking on the most troublesome users, and going forward, if we do not see the situation improve, we will continue to take privileges from communities whose users continually cross the line\u2014up to an outright ban.\n\nAgain, I am sorry for the trouble I have caused. While I intended no harm, that was not the result, and I hope these changes improve your experience on Reddit.\n\nSteve\n\nPS: As a bonus, I have enabled filtering for r/all for all users.

            "selftext": "Dearest Redditors,\n\nWe have been hard at work the past few months adding features, improving our ads business, and protecting users. Here is some of the stuff we have been up to:\n\nHopefully you did not notice, but as of last week, the m.reddit.com is powered by an entirely new tech platform. We call it 2X. In addition to load times being significantly faster for users (by about 2x\u2026) development is also much quicker. This means faster iteration and more improvements going forward. Our recently released [AMP site](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/53q42z/read_reddit_faster_via_google_with_amp/) and moderator mail are already running on 2X.\n\nSpeaking of modmail, the beta we [announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) a couple months ago is going well. Thirty communities volunteered to help us iron out the kinks (thank you, r/DIY!). The community [feedback](http://reddit.com/r/modmailbeta) has been invaluable, and we are incorporating as much as we can in preparation for the general release, which we expect to be sometime next month.\n\nPrepare your pitchforks: we are enabling basic interest targeting in our advertising product. This will allow advertisers to target audiences based on a handful of predefined interests (e.g. sports, gaming, music, etc.), which will be informed by which communities they frequent. A targeted ad is more relevant to users and more valuable to advertisers. We describe this functionality in our [privacy policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy/) and have added a permanent link to this [opt-out page](https://www.reddit.com/adsprefs). The main changes are in 'Advertising and Analytics\u2019. The opt-out is per-browser, so it should work for both logged in and logged out users.\n\nWe have a cool community feature in the works as well. Improved [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/59jkbq/reddit_change_spoiler_tags_beta/) went into beta earlier today. Communities have long been using tricks with NSFW tags to hide spoilers, which is clever, but also results in side-effects like actual NSFW content everywhere just because you want to discuss the latest episode of The Walking Dead.\n\nWe did have some fun with Atlantic Recording Corporation in the last couple of months.  After a user posted a link to a leaked Twenty One Pilots song from the Suicide Squad soundtrack, Atlantic petitioned a NY court to order us to turn over all information related to the user and any users with the same IP address. We pushed back on the request, and our lawyer, who knows how to turn a phrase, opposed the petition by arguing, \"Because Atlantic seeks to use pre-action discovery as an impermissible fishing expedition to determine if it has a plausible claim for breach of contract or breach of fiduciary duty against the Reddit user and not as a means to match an existing, meritorious claim to an individual, its petition for pre-action discovery should be denied.\" After seeing our opposition and arguing its case in front of a NY judge, Atlantic withdrew its petition entirely, signaling our victory. While pushing back on these requests requires time and money on our end, we believe it is important for us to ensure applicable legal standards are met before we disclose user information.\n\nLastly, we are celebrating the kick-off of our eighth annual Secret Santa exchange next Tuesday on Reddit Gifts! It is true Reddit tradition, often filled with great gifts and surprises. If you have never participated, now is the perfect time to [create an account](https://www.redditgifts.com/profiles/signup/). It will be a fantastic event this year.\n\nI will be hanging around to answer questions about this or anything else for the next hour or so.\n\nSteve\n\nu: I'm out for now. Will check back later.

Both our [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&amp;hl=en) apps have had [multiple releases](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditmobile), and we\u2019re proud at how well they are progressing. Mobile web (m.reddit.com) is undergoing a major overhaul that we\u2019re testing internally, and hope to start showing to users in the next couple weeks. We have been running many experiments on desktop web to increase user engagement, particularly for users who are new to Reddit. You can see what experiments we are running on this [live thread](https://www.reddit.com/live/x3ckzbsj6myw/), and notable changes to the site are listed in r/changelog.\n\nWe\u2019ve started development on a new frontpage algorithm. The current algorithm is outdated and is no longer meeting our needs. There are a number of problems we\u2019d like to solve: increased velocity, improved personalization, reduced dependence on /new, and not requiring us to choose the defaults. We\u2019re still in the early days, but I\u2019m happy we\u2019re dedicating resources to it.\n\nAs it relates to monetization, we\u2019ve made a handful of changes: we [tested adding affiliate tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4mv578/affiliate_links_on_reddit/) to e-commerce links, which we ended up turning off; we announced [Promoted User Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4upf11/new_ad_type_promoted_user_posts/); and we announced [tests we\u2019ll be running](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4phzsi/sponsored_headline_tests_placement_and_design/) on sponsored headlines. Changes and additions to ads can be met with skepticism, and this is why we test changes carefully and listen to feedback. As we evolve our ads platform, we are working to do it in a way that that complements the core experience and engages redditors. These changes and experiments will continue to happen, but while it is critical that we build Reddit into a sustainable business, we don\u2019t want to compromise what\u2019s brought us here. Going forward, we will list these in r/changelog so all these kinds of announcements are in one place.\n\nYesterday, we previewed [new moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) to moderators. This has been a long time coming, and we\u2019re excited to show it off. The current moderator mail system is a hack on top of our messaging system, which is itself a hack on top of our commenting system. The new tool should save a lot of time for everyone, and new tech stack will allow for better future iterations and builds. We\u2019ll be working with moderators to refine it while we work towards a full rollout.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen great results from our Anti-Evil, Trust &amp; Safety, and Community teams. The mandate of these teams is to eliminate spam and abuse and to ensure Reddit is a welcoming place for all. In the last quarter, we\u2019ve reduced harassment reports by 15%, spam reports by 66%, and moderator spam removals by 15%. We\u2019ve also reduced our support ticket backlog substantially, dropping our average response time from 64 hours to 7 in the process.\n\nHappy to chat about this stuff, or anything else.\n\ne: grammar\n\nu: Thank you!

Despite being one of Reddit's most controversial posts ever, it was a successful AMA.\n\nThe short for answer is because of anti-cheating techniques that we have used for many years. While a post is young, the score we display is not the same as the score we sort by. We do this so that spammers, cheaters, and brigaders don\u2019t know if their tactics are working. A vote \u2013 valid or not \u2013 appears to count, but over time the displayed score becomes more accurate. [This affects all posts the same](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/z1sfn/one_minute_obamas_ama_karma_score_was_16000_a/), and has for [a long time](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/3g6ghn/reddit_change_the_scores_of_extremelypopular/).\n\nWe saw this play out again on Donald Trump\u2019s AMA today. While the post did receive many [upvotes](https://i.redd.it/ok76t3hj1wbx.png) initially, it was also one of the most controversial posts ever on Reddit, and received nearly as many downvotes. We did work with the r/the_donald mod team to ensure this AMA ran smoothly for everyone involved.\n\nOverall, please keep in mind the AMA was a success. It was seen by many thousands of people, generated thousands of comments on the site, and has spurred many discussions off of Reddit itself. You should know only 4% of Reddit actually visits r/all, so this post\u2019s ranking in that listing had practically no effect on the overall success of the AMA.\n\nAs always, thank you for redditing and for participating in the AMA.",

The r/all listing gives us a glimpse into what is happening on all of Reddit independent of specific interests or subscriptions. In many ways, r/all is a reflection of what is happening online in general. It is culturally important and drives many conversations around the world.\n\nThe changes we are making are to preserve this aspect of r/all\u2014our specific goal being to prevent any one community from dominating the listing. The algorithm change is fairly simple\u2014as a community is represented more and more often in the listing, the hotness of its posts will be increasingly lessened. This results in more variety in r/all.\n\nMany people will ask if this is related to r/the_donald. The short answer is no, we have been working on this change for a while, but I cannot deny their behavior hastened its deployment. We have seen many communities like r/the_donald over the years\u2014ones that attempt to dominate the conversation on Reddit at the expense of everyone else. This undermines Reddit, and we are not going to allow it. \n\nInterestingly enough, r/the_donald was already getting downvoted out of r/all yesterday morning before we made any changes. It seems the rest of the Reddit community had had enough. Ironically, r/EnoughTrumpSpam was hit harder than any other community when we rolled out the changes. That\u2019s Reddit for you. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\nAs always, we will keep an eye out for any unintended side-effects and make changes as necessary.

Let\u2019s remember that first and foremost, this was a devastating and visceral human experience that many individuals and whole communities were, and continue to be, affected by. In the grand scheme of things, this is what is most important today.\n\nI would like to address what happened on Reddit this past weekend. Many of you use Reddit as your primary source of news, and we have a duty to provide access to timely information during a crisis. This is a responsibility we take seriously.\n\nThe story broke on r/news, as is common. In such situations, their community is flooded with all manners of posts. Their policy includes removing duplicate posts to focus the conversation in one place, and removing speculative posts until facts are established. A few posts were removed incorrectly, which have now been restored. One moderator did cross the line with their behavior, and is no longer a part of the team. We have seen the accusations of censorship. We have investigated, and beyond the posts that are now restored, have not found evidence to support these claims.\n\nWhether you agree with r/news\u2019 policies or not, it is never acceptable to harass users or moderators. Expressing your anger is fine. Sending death threats is not. We will be taking action against users, moderators, posts, and communities that encourage such behavior.\n\nWe are working with r/news to understand the challenges faced and their actions taken throughout, and we will work more closely with moderators of large communities in future times of crisis. We\u2013Reddit Inc, moderators, and users\u2013all have a duty to ensure access to timely information is available.\n\nIn the wake of this weekend, we will be making a handful of technology and process changes:\n\n* Live threads are the best place for news to break and for the community to stay updated on the events. We are working to make this more timely, evident, and organized.\n* [We\u2019re introducing a change to Sticky Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4ny8y6/renaming_sticky_posts_to_announcements/): They\u2019ll now be called Announcement Posts, which better captures their intended purpose; they will only be able to be created by moderators; and they must be text posts. Votes will continue to count. We are making this change to prevent the use of Sticky Posts to organize bad behavior.\n* We are working on a change to the r/all algorithm to promote more diversity in the feed, which will help provide more variety of viewpoints and prevent vote manipulation.\n* We are nearly fully staffed on our Community team, and will continue increasing support for moderator teams of major communities.\n\nAgain, what happened in Orlando is horrible, and above all, we need to keep things in perspective. We\u2019ve all been set back by the events, but we will move forward together to do better next time. ",

We diverted resources to combat this, and we have made quite a bit of progress, lowering user reported spam by over 60% from its high point last quarter. We still have plenty of work to do, but we are making steady progress. Removing as spam or reporting as such are still the most effective ways to help.\n\n* **Account Take-Overs** (ATOs): In response to our improved spam-fighting measures, the bad-guys have been targeting existing accounts, compromising them for the purpose of spamming and vote cheating. We are fighting ATOs on the engineering side, but ATOs also create a burden on our community team to notify affected users, send password reset emails, etc. We are working on automating the notification and recovery processes to free up our community managers. The root cause of the issue is poor passwords. Please use strong and unique passwords.\n\n* **Support Backlog**: Because of the aforementioned issues, our community team is swamped with support tickets. We are doing a good job keeping up with the incoming flow, but we do have a backlog that is taking time to work through. We are sorry for any delays. The good news is we have a number of new people joining the team over the next few weeks that will help.\n\n* **Modmail**: I am happy to report that we finally have a team dedicated to working on a new system for moderator mail. To this point, we have tried a number of approaches and have had a handful of false starts, but we have not made the sort of progress we would like. The current system is a series of hacks built on an old code base, and because of this, we have decided to build modmail as a new, separate system. This will allow us to develop it without disrupting your current workflows. We know this is where you spend a lot of your time, and we are working hard to make it more effective.\n\nWe appreciate all you do for Reddit as moderators, and we appreciate seeing the questions you ask in this community. We are particularly thankful for those of you who jump in and help the other moderators here and elsewhere.\n\n\u2013 The Reddit Team",

We made a commitment to you to publish an annual report, detailing government and law enforcement agency requests for private information about our users. In keeping with that promise, we\u2019ve published our [2015 transparency report](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2015). \n\nWe hope that sharing this information will help you better understand our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy) and demonstrate our commitment for Reddit to remain a place that actively encourages authentic conversation.\n\nOur goal is to provide information about the number and types of requests for user account information and removal of content that we receive, and how often we are legally required to respond. This isn\u2019t easy as a small company as we don\u2019t always have the tools we need to accurately track the large volume of requests we receive. We will continue, when legally possible, to inform users before sharing user account information in response to these requests.\n\nIn 2015, we did not produce records in response to 40% of government requests, and we did not remove content in response to 79% of government requests.\n\nIn 2016, we\u2019ve taken further steps to protect the privacy of our users. We joined our industry peers in an amicus brief [supporting Twitter](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/3/3d/Twitter_versus_Lynch_Amicus_Brief_February_2016.pdf), detailing our desire to be honest about the national security requests for removal of content and the disclosure of user account information.\n\nIn addition, we joined an amicus brief [supporting Apple](http://images.apple.com/pr/pdf/Airbnb_Atlassian_Automattic_CloudFlare_eBay_GitHub_Kickstarter_LinkedIn_Mapbox_Medium_Meetup_Reddit_Square_Squarespace_Twilio_Twitter_and_Wickr.pdf) in their fight against the government's attempt to force a private company to work on behalf of them. While the government asked the court to [vacate the court order](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/28/technology/document-us-filing-dropping-apple-case.html) compelling Apple to assist them, we felt it was important to stand with Apple and speak out against this unprecedented move by the government, which threatens the relationship of trust between a platforms and its users, in addition to jeopardizing your privacy. \n\nWe are also excited to announce the launch of our [external law enforcement guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/law_enforcement_guidelines). Beyond clarifying how Reddit works as a platform and briefly outlining how both federal and state law enforcements can compel Reddit to turn over user information, we believe they make very clear that we adhere to strict standards. \n\nWe know the success of Reddit is made possible by your trust. We hope this transparency report strengthens that trust, and is a signal to you that we care deeply about your privacy.\n\n(I'll do my best to answer questions, but as with all legal matters, I can't always be completely candid.)\n\nedit: I'm off for now. There are a few questions that I'll try to answer after I get clarification.\n",

            "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nNow that 2015 is in the books, it\u2019s a good time to reflect on where we are and where we are going. Since I returned last summer, my goal has been to bring a sense of calm; to rebuild our relationship with our users and moderators; and to improve the fundamentals of our business so that we can focus on making you (our users), those that work here, and the world in general, proud of Reddit. Reddit\u2019s mission is to help people discover places where they can be themselves and to empower the community to flourish.\n\n2015 was a big year for Reddit. First off, we cleaned up many of our external policies including our Content Policy, Privacy Policy, and API terms. We also established internal policies for managing requests from law enforcement and governments. Prior to my return, [Reddit took an industry-changing stance on involuntary pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/).\n\nReddit is a collection of communities, and the moderators play a critical role shepherding these communities. It is our job to help them do this. We have shipped a [number of improvements](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/new/) to these tools, and while we have a long way to go, I am happy to see steady progress.\n\nSpam and abuse threaten Reddit\u2019s communities. We created a Trust and Safety team to focus on abuse at scale, which has the added benefit of freeing up our Community team to focus on the positive aspects of our communities. We are still in transition, but you should feel the impact of the change more as we progress. We know we have a lot to do here.\n\nI believe we have positioned ourselves to have a strong 2016. A phrase we will be using a lot around here is \"Look Forward.\" Reddit has a long history, and it\u2019s important to focus on the future to ensure we live up to our potential. Whether you access it from your desktop, a mobile browser, or a native app, we will work to make the Reddit product more engaging. Mobile in particular continues to be a priority for us. Our new Android app is going into beta today, and our new iOS app should follow it out soon.\n\nWe receive many requests from law enforcement and governments. We take our stewardship of your data seriously, and we know transparency is important to you, which is why we are putting together a Transparency Report. This will be available in March.\n\nThis year will see a lot of changes on Reddit. Recently we built an A/B testing system, which allows us to test changes to individual features scientifically, and we are excited to put it through its paces. Some changes will be big, others small and, inevitably, not everything will work, but all our efforts are towards making Reddit better. We are all redditors, and we are all driven to understand why Reddit works for some people, but not for others; which changes are working, and what effect they have; and to get into a rhythm of constant improvement. We appreciate your patience while we modernize Reddit.\n\nAs always, Reddit would not exist without you, our community, so thank you. We are all excited about what 2016 has in store for us.\n\n\u2013Steve\n\nedit: I'm off. Thanks for the feedback and questions. We've got a lot to deliver on this year, but the whole team is excited for what's in store. We've brought on a bunch of new people lately, but our biggest need is still hiring.

You, our community of developers, are important to us, and have been instrumental to the success of the Reddit platform. First and foremost, we want to reaffirm our commitment to providing (and improving!) a public API.\n\nThere are a couple of notable changes to the API terms that I\u2019d like to highlight. The first is that we are requesting all users of the API to register with us. This provides a point of contact for when we have important updates to share; provides a point of contact for when things go wrong; and helps us prevent abuse.\n\nWe are also no longer requiring a special licensing agreement to use our API for commercial purposes. We do request that you seek approval for your monetization model in the registration process.\n\nWe have added clarity about the types of things that the API is not intended for\u2013namely applications that promote illegal activity, disrupt core Reddit functionality, or introduce security risks. But you weren\u2019t doing any of these things anyway.\n\nWe still require users of our API to comply with our User Agreement, Privacy Policy, API Usage Limits, and any other applicable laws or regulations. We will continue to require the use of OAuth2.  We understand moving to OAuth2 can take time, so we are giving developers until March 17th to make this change.\n\nWe look forward to working with you more to create great experiences for our communities. There are many wonderful projects built on our API, and we would love to see even more. Thank you for all that you do.\n\nYou can contact the api@reddit.com alias to ask questions about the API service.",

We know this is important to you, so I want to explain what has changed and why.\n\nKeeping control in your hands is paramount to us, and this is our first consideration any time we change our privacy policy. Our overarching principle continues to be to request as little personally identifiable information as possible. To the extent that we store such information, we do not share it generally. Where there are exceptions to this, notably when you have given us explicit consent to do so, or in response to legal requests, we will spell them out clearly.\n\nThe new policy is functionally very similar to the previous one, but it\u2019s shorter, simpler, and less repetitive. We have clarified what information we collect automatically (basically anything your browser sends us) and what we share with advertisers (nothing specific to your Reddit account).\n\nOne notable change is that we are increasing the number of days we store IP addresses from 90 to 100 so we can measure usage across an entire quarter. In addition to internal analytics, the primary reason we store IPs is to fight spam and abuse. I believe in the future we will be able to accomplish this without storing IPs at all (e.g. with hashing), but we still need to work out the details.\n\nIn addition to changes to our Privacy Policy, we are also beginning to roll out support for [Do Not Track](http://donottrack.us/). Do Not Track is an option you can enable in modern browsers to notify websites that you do not wish to be tracked, and websites can interpret it however they like (most ignore it). If you have Do Not Track enabled, we will not load any third-party analytics. We will keep you informed as we develop more uses for it in the future.\n\nIndividually, you have control over what information you share with us and what your browser sends to us automatically. I encourage everyone to understand how browsers and the web work and what steps you can take to protect your own privacy. Notably, browsers allow you to disable [third-party cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Third-party_cookie), and you can customize your browser with a variety of privacy-related [extensions](http://lifehacker.com/the-best-browser-extensions-that-protect-your-privacy-479408034).\n\nWe are proud that Reddit is home to many of the most open and genuine conversations online, and we know this is only made possible by your trust, without which we would not exist. We will continue to do our best to earn this trust and to respect your basic assumptions of privacy.\n\nThank you for reading. I\u2019ll be here for an hour to answer questions, and I'll check back in again the week of Dec 14th before the changes take effect.\n\n-Steve (spez)\n\nedit: Thanks for all the feedback.

Your thoughts and opinions were invaluable. This is not the last time our policies will change, of course.

One new concept is Quarantining a community, which entails applying a set of restrictions to a community so its content will only be viewable to those who explicitly opt in. We will Quarantine communities whose content would be considered extremely offensive to the average redditor.\n\nToday, in addition to applying Quarantines, we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors, prevent us from improving Reddit, and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else. Our most important policy over the last ten years has been to allow just about anything so long as it does not prevent others from enjoying Reddit for what it is: the best place online to have truly authentic conversations.\n\nI believe these policies strike the right balance.\n\nupdate: I know some of you are upset because we banned *anything* today, but the fact of the matter is we spend a disproportionate amount of time dealing with a handful of communities, which prevents us from working on things for the other 99.98% (literally) of Reddit.

            "selftext": "We started Reddit to be\u2014as we said back then with our tongues in our cheeks\u2014\u201cThe front page of the Internet.\u201d Reddit was to be a source of enough news, entertainment, and random distractions to fill an entire day of pretending to work, every day. Occasionally, someone would start spewing hate, and I would ban them. The community rarely questioned me. When they did, they accepted my reasoning: \u201cbecause I don\u2019t want that content on our site.\u201d\n\nAs we grew, I became increasingly uncomfortable projecting my worldview on others. More practically, I didn\u2019t have time to pass judgement on everything, so I decided to judge nothing. \n\nSo we entered a phase that can best be described as Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell. This worked temporarily, but once people started paying attention, few liked what they found. A handful of painful controversies usually resulted in the removal of a few communities, but with inconsistent reasoning and no real change in policy.\n\nOne thing that isn't up for debate is why Reddit exists. Reddit is a place to have open and authentic discussions. The reason we\u2019re careful to restrict speech is because people have more open and authentic discussions when they aren't worried about the speech police knocking down their door. When our purpose comes into conflict with a policy, we make sure our purpose wins.\n\nAs Reddit has grown, we've seen additional examples of how unfettered free speech can make Reddit a less enjoyable place to visit, and can even cause people harm outside of Reddit. Earlier this year, [Reddit took a stand and banned non-consensual pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/). This was largely accepted by the community, and the world is a better place as a result (Google and Twitter have followed suit). Part of the reason this went over so well was because there was a very clear line of what was unacceptable.\n\nTherefore, today we're announcing that we're considering a set of additional restrictions on what people can say on Reddit\u2014or at least say on our public pages\u2014in the spirit of our mission.\n\nThese types of content are prohibited [1]:\n\n * Spam\n * Anything illegal (i.e. things that are actually illegal, such as copyrighted material. Discussing illegal activities, such as drug use, is not illegal)\n * Publication of someone\u2019s private and confidential information\n * Anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people (it's ok to say \"I don't like this group of people.\" It's not ok to say, \"I'm going to kill this group of people.\")\n * Anything that [harasses, bullies, or abuses](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html) an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)[2]\n * Sexually suggestive content featuring minors\n\nThere are other types of content that are specifically classified:\n\n * Adult content must be flagged as NSFW (Not Safe For Work). Users must opt into seeing NSFW communities. This includes pornography, which is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it.\n * Similar to NSFW, another type of content that is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it, is the content that violates a common sense of decency. This classification will require a login, must be opted into, will not appear in search results or public listings, and will generate no revenue for Reddit.\n\nWe've had the NSFW classification since nearly the beginning, and it's worked well to separate the pornography from the rest of Reddit. We believe there is value in letting all views exist, even if we find some of them abhorrent, as long as they don\u2019t pollute people\u2019s enjoyment of the site. Separation and opt-in techniques have worked well for keeping adult content out of the common Redditor\u2019s listings, and we think it\u2019ll work for this other type of content as well. \n\nNo company is perfect at addressing these hard issues. We\u2019ve spent the last few days here discussing and agree that an approach like this allows us as a company to repudiate content we don\u2019t want to associate with the business, but gives individuals freedom to consume it if they choose. This is what we will try, and if the hateful users continue to spill out into mainstream reddit, we will try more aggressive approaches. Freedom of expression is important to us, but it\u2019s more important to us that we at reddit be true to our mission.\n\n[1] This is basically what we have right now. I\u2019d appreciate your thoughts. A very clear line is important and our language should be precise.\n\n[2] Wording we've used elsewhere is this \"Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them.\"\n\nedit: added an example to clarify our concept of \"harm\"\nedit: attempted to clarify harassment based on our existing policy\n\nupdate: I'm out of here, everyone.

Our top priority at reddit is to develop a comprehensive Content Policy and the tools to enforce it.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of content on reddit comes from wonderful, creative, funny, smart, and silly communities. That is what makes reddit great. There is also a dark side, communities whose purpose is reprehensible, and we don\u2019t have any obligation to support them. And we also believe that some communities currently on the platform should not be here at all.\n\nNeither Alexis nor I created reddit to be a bastion of free speech, but rather as a place where open and honest discussion can happen:  These are very complicated issues, and we are putting a lot of thought into it. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve been thinking about for quite some time.  We haven\u2019t had the tools to enforce policy, but now we\u2019re building those tools and reevaluating our policy.\n\nWe as a community need to decide together what our values are. To that end, I\u2019ll be hosting an AMA on Thursday 1pm pst to present our current thinking to you, the community, and solicit your feedback.\n\nPS - I won\u2019t be able to hang out in comments right now. Still meeting everyone here!",

            "selftext": "We're working on a couple of things that will hopefully help avoid future eruptions like the one of the past few days:\n\n * We're improving the popularity metric for reddits. Specifically, attacking a reddit will not boost its popularity. This will take some time, but we'll get there.\n\n * No mercy for attacking a reddit. Starting now, anyone who mass-downvotes every link on a reddit will have their voting privileges removed.\n\n**FAQ**\n\n*Why was /r/atheism removed from the default reddit list for non-logged-in users again?*\n\nFor the past few months the default reddits have been the top ten most popular reddits, which are automatically computed each morning from the previous day's activity. /r/atheism went through a couple of weeks under attack from other users causing it to appear more popular than it should have been. At the time this was an isolated issue, so we didn't do much about it. When the same thing happened to /r/moviecritic, we addressed the issue by removing the two less popular reddits from the list by hand. Given the two bullet points above, this will no longer be necessary.\n\n*Why was /r/atheism removed from the top bar as well?*\n\nThis was a side-effect of how we removed it from the front page. We used the same function for both returning the list of reddits for the front page and returning the list of reddits for the top bar. It was a mistake, and is fixed now.\n\n*Why is the /r/christianity reddit so popular all of a sudden?*\n\nContrary to popular belief, this isn't my or anyone else at reddit's handy-work. It is because a handful of /r/atheism users are downvoting every story on /r/christianity. As I have previously mentioned, this actually makes a reddit more popular, an unintended side-effect of how we rank reddits. I'm working on undoing the attack, but this will take time. Of course, I will also undo any attacks against any other reddits as well.\n\n*Will /r/atheism ever appear on the front page?*\n\nIf it gets more popular, it will be possible.\n\n*But it has more than 50,000 subscribers, it must be popular!*\n\nSubscribers aren't a factor in a reddit's popularity. It's popularity is determined by level of activity.\n\n*You said something previously about not all content being appropriate for the front page. What's the deal with that?*\n\nIn the past we chose the front-page reddits by hand, and in the future we might do that again, but it's not something we're actively working on. There are over 25,000 communities on reddit, and only 10 appear on the front page. It's nothing personal. We want to have a large variety of content on the front page to demonstrate that there is something here for everyone. If we start engineering the front page again, it'll be clear what we're doing, and how we're doing it.\n\n*Everything you say is a lie. You clearly hate atheists. Why should I believe you now?*\n\nEver since Alexis and I founded reddit.com over four years ago, we've worked hard to make this a place where anyone can come and share new and interesting links. We've (and me, specifically) have made mistakes, but we've done our best to fix them and move on, and I think our actions over the past four years speak for themselves. You're free to dislike me/us, and we will proudly continue to provide a forum for you to do so on this site.",

            "selftext": "Skip to the second half if you don't care about how we got to this point.\n\nFirst, a little history: When we first allowed users to create their\nown reddits, every link from every reddit had an equal chance at being\nseen on our front page. We had to tweak this slightly with the rise in\npopularity of the [nsfw](http://www.reddit.com/r/nsfw) reddit and put some reddits behind an \"are\nyou over 18?\" barrier, a change that was welcomed by most users. Next,\nwe allowed users to choose which reddits appear on their front page,\nbut it wasn't until we started normalizing the front page that we ran\ninto issues.\n\nWhen the front page is normalized, a link that is #1 in a small reddit\nis basically equal in hotness to a link that is #1 in a large reddit.\nThis helps prevent small reddits from being washed out by the larger\nones. Because of this change we had to also limit the number of\nreddits that make up the front page, otherwise things would jump\naround wildly (a user could create a new reddit, submit one link, and\nsince that link was #1 in its reddit, it could appear on the front\npage). For quite some time we maintained this list of front page\nreddits by hand.\n\nMaintaining the list of front page reddits became tedious after a\nwhile, so we added a new algorithm to find the most active reddits\nautomatically. This algorithm purposefully ignores the number of\nsubscribers when choosing reddits since that number is so easy to\ngame. The popularity of a reddit is based on the number of\nsubmissions, votes, and general level of activity of the reddit. The\nalgorithm changes from time to time, and we don't describe it fully to\nmitigate gaming it. We use the top ten reddits returned by this\nalgorithm to make up the default non-logged-in front page.\n\n**Here's the explanation part you're looking for**\n\nA couple of weeks ago the [moviecritic](http://www.reddit.com/r/moviecritic) reddit popped into the top ten\nreddits, causing quite a stir. The reddit isn't used for new and\ninteresting links, but rather for links to movies: sometimes old and\nsometimes new. Users were upset that moviecritic was taking up\nfront-page space and started attacking the reddit by downvoting\neverything in sight. Users of the [atheism](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism) reddit had been under\nattacks like this for weeks. Unfortunately, attacking a reddit\ngenerates a lot of activity on that reddit and makes our algorithm\nthink the reddit is more popular than it really is, making the problem\neven worse. \n\nSeeing as this might become an ongoing problem, we added the ability\nto prevent certain reddits from appearing in the top ten. We flagged\nmoviecritic and atheism as two such reddits, hopefully allowing these\nreddits to grow in peace. I should have posted this explanation then\ninstead of waiting until now, and for that I apologize.\n\nGiven the nature and somtimes polarizing tone of the\ncontent on the atheism reddit, it will likely always garner the ire of\nmany other users. Showcasing religious flame-wars only serves to lower the level of discourse on the site as a whole, and unknowingly walking into such a flame-war isn't the first-time experience we'd like new users to have here, which is why we think it best to leave things the way they are.  \n\nThere are thousands of communities on reddit covering a wide range of\ntopics. Most are for sharing new and interesting content from around\nthe web, and others are strictly for discussion. We hope there is a\nplace for everyone on reddit, and we also hope you realize not\neverything found on reddit is appropriate for the front page.\n\nUPDATE: I'll try and rephrase a point that I didn't get across before. /moviecritic and /atheism aren't legitimate top ten reddits. They appeared that way because they were under attack, making them appear even more popular. Removing atheism from the top ten by hand isn't about censoring, it's about a shortcoming in our popularity metric. We'll fix the problem, and that'll be the end of it.",
